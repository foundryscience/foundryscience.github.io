## Engineering a generalizable treatment for cancer

We have known for a long time that there is no &ldquo;magic bullet&rdquo; to curing cancer. Yet we continue to search for drugs with that very mindset: first design a molecule that shows therapeutic effect on its own, then consider synergistic interactions it may have with other drugs.

However, we know that cancer is a complex disease; we must consider not only the cancer cells themselves, but their lineage, the tumor microenvironment, and host immunity. We also need to consider how cancer cells adapt to treatments, and the patient's natural bodily responses to interventions.<Ref id="2"/>

**The solution is to engineer multiple therapeutics that work cohesively** to defeat the multiple defenses of cancer, and to **consider the treatment regimen during the development of the therapies**.

To accurately understand and assess our combination treatments, we need better models that recapitulate tumor biology. Currently, tumors-on-a-chip appear to be the most accurate and scalable approach.

We will also need to identify a wider range of drug targets, for both cancer cells and the tumor stroma. 

Finally, we will need to expand the number of therapeutic modalities so that we can use the right tool for the given constraints. Our toolkit will include, but is not limited to, synthetic chemistry, chemical engineering, protein engineering, and synthetic biology.
